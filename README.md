## About Me

Hello, I'm Mayuna. I am passionate about computer vision, medical artificial intelligence, machine learning, and anything and everything related to AI :)

## Projects

### Project 1: Gallbladder Cancer Detection

#### Overview:
In this project, I worked on making medical imaging, particularly ultrasound (USG), more effective in detecting diseases. Focusing on Gallbladder Cancer, our team created an intelligent algorithm to identify cancer features in USG videos. Using this technology, we achieved an impressive 96% accuracy in classifying videos, bringing us closer to non-invasive and reliable diagnostic solutions.

#### Significance:
This project is about using AI to enhance how we detect health issues, especially in cases like Gallbladder Cancer, where traditional methods face challenges. By improving the accuracy of medical imaging, we aim to make diagnoses quicker and more accessible, potentially saving lives.

#### Results:
Our innovative approach showcased outstanding accuracy and provided clear explanations for doctors. This means our AI system doesn't just predict; it helps medical professionals understand why a diagnosis was made. This project represents a step forward in making medical AI more trustworthy and effective in real-world scenarios.

### Project 2: Forecasting the EL-Nino Southern Oscillation using Sea Surface Temperatures

#### Overview:
In this project, I used advanced technology to predict the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), a crucial weather pattern in India. By analyzing sea surface temperatures and leveraging machine learning, I forecasted the monsoon's intensity 12 months in advance. This groundbreaking work surpassed existing models, enhancing our ability to prepare for and understand the monsoon's impact on agriculture.

#### Significance:
Accurate predictions are essential for farmers, as they help in planning their agricultural activities, ensuring a better harvest. The success of this project not only contributes to scientific knowledge but also supports the livelihoods of the millions of farmers who depend on the monsoon for their crops.

#### Results:
The model achieved an 87% accuracy in explaining past monsoon anomalies and outperformed 85% of existing models. This project represents a significant step forward in atmospheric science, with potential applications in improving agricultural practices and mitigating the effects of climate-related disruptions.
